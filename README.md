# Task Manager Application

This project is a **Task Manager** application developed using **Angular**, **NodeJS**, and **MongoDB**. The application offers users the ability to manage their tasks efficiently with features like task creation, editing, and deletion. It also provides a clean and modern user interface, styled with **Bulma**, a popular CSS framework.

## Project Structure

### Frontend

- The frontend is built using **Angular** and uses **SCSS** for styling.
- **Bulma** is used as the CSS framework to ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
- The application has routing enabled for navigation between different pages.
- It includes a task management page (`TaskView`) where users can manage their tasks.

### Backend

- The backend is powered by **NodeJS** and **Express** to handle RESTful API requests.
- It interacts with a **MongoDB** database using **Mongoose** for data persistence.
- The API handles all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for task management.

### Database

- **MongoDB** is used as the database to store task data.
- You can either use a local instance of MongoDB or set up a cloud database using services like **MongoDB Atlas**.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Users can create, update, view, and delete tasks.
- **Routing**: The app uses Angular's built-in routing to navigate between different views seamlessly.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is mobile-friendly, thanks to the integration of **Bulma**.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in a MongoDB database for future retrieval.
- **REST API**: The backend provides a RESTful API to interact with the task data.
